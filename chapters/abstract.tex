This project presents the high level control of an Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) through Marker-Based visual commands. First experimental setups run in a computer simulated world inside Gazebo simulator\cite{GazeboSimulator} and then experiments are conducted with the real MAV. In the simulation the visual commands are given from a usb-camera connected to the computer while in the latter case from the MAV's camera sensor. In both cases the used visual markers are Apriltags\cite{richardson2013iros}.
