In this project is presented the high level control of a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) through Marker-Based visual commands. First all the system's parts were built and tested in simulation. Then experiments were conducted on a real MAV platform to evaluate our experimental results. Both in simulation and in the real system the used visual markers were Apriltags\cite{olson2011tags}.
