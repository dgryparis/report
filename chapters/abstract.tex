In this project is presented the high level control of a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) through Marker-Based visual commands. In this project the main objective, is to control the pose of an AscTecâ€™s Firefly MAV, based only on the detections of specific visual markers from its camera sensor. At all cases, we want to ensure the user's safety, thus we emphasize at always leaving a safety distance between the MAV and the user. Furthermore, we also want to maximize the detection rate of the markers. In order to achieve our goals, all the system's parts were built and tested in simulation and then experiments were conducted on a real MAV platform to evaluate our results. Both in simulation and in the real system the used visual markers were Apriltags\cite{olson2011tags}.
